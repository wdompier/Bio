      <h2>Hello !</h2>

      <p class="hello">After a long and successful career, corporate downsizing forced me to take a really hard look at what I really wanted to do in life,
        and more importantly -- what inspires me. This journey has taken a few years, and has had a few twists and turns getting there, but I
        began to open up and share my passion for photography by starting the
        <a class="dompierphoto" href="https://dompierphoto.picfair.com/">Dompier Photography Webstore</a> on Picfair, and the
        <a class="dompierphotof" href="https://www.facebook.com/dompierphoto">Dompier Photography Facebook page</a> with my wife. We currently
        have 500+ followers, and we hope to double that in the coming months.
      </p>

      <p class="hello">I soon discovered that although there are many websites to showcase photography, none of them have really met <strong><span class="my">my</span></strong>
        needs or aspirations. And so, I began my initial journey into web development in order to showcase my photography more effectively. As
        I began training to become a full stack web & application developer, I also found that I enjoyed it so much that I would eventually like to use my
        skills in the freelance market. My new goal is to finish a photography website in 2022, and begin to develop a portfolio of web development projects
        to showcase my skills in 2023.

        <h2>About Wane</h2>
        <p class="hello">
          I am a photographer who is inspired by nature, travel, culture, and urban living. I have an adventurous spirit and have traveled extensively in Asia, parts of Europe, and North America.
          Working with different cultures has developed an appreciation for diverse cultures and views. Living in Colorado, I have naturally tended to focus on the world around me - nature.
          In 2022, I am working on developing my information technology skills toward web development, application development and programming, as well as Web3 and NFT's.
        </p>
        <p class="hello">
          I also hold a bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineering and an Masters of Business Administration (MBA) with a concentration in Finance. After experiencing corporate downsizing,
          I decided to try a very different career that afforded me a new lifestyle. I worked as an OTR (over-the-road) truck driver for (3) years until I once again saw an opportunity to bridge
          my truck driving skills with high technology. I am currently working as an Autonomous Vehicle Test Operator at <strong><a href="https://www.outrider.ai/">Outrider</a></strong>
          helping test, operate, maintain, and evaluate the Outrider System. This is a first-of-its-kind product designed to automate the world's largest distribution yards. Outrider
          is a strong software start-up company that is inspiring me to grow my own software skills.

        <h3>Supply Chain & Transportation ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</h3>
        <p>I have held many corporate positions in supply chain with high technology companies. After experiencing corporate downsizing, I decided to move to a different
          career in transportation. I worked as an OTR (over-the-road) truck driver, and am now working as an Autonomous Vehicle Test Operator at Outrider. As a strong software company,
          Outrider is inspiring me to grow my own software skills.

        <h3>Photography ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</h3>
        <p>Photography has been my passion for many years. When I was 12 years old, I started using whatever camera I could find, but later purchased my first
          35mm SLR camera: A Minolta SRT201 film camera. I moved into the digital age many years ago, and currently use a Canon EOS-R Mirrorless Camera for all of my photography.
          Living in Colorado, I have tended to focus my photography on nature, landscape, & wildlife.

        <p>Linux is one of the top three operating systems in the world. I have a basic understanding of Linux, but decided to expand my knowledge and become
          qualified in Linux Administration. I am currently taking online classes, and although I have not decided which certification that I will get,
          it is my goal to become certified as an administrator. Future classes in 2022 will include Bash shell scripting and specialized aministation classes.
